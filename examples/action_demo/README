Test Scenario: Action Demo
--------------------------

This directory is provided for test purposes, and we recommend running
the included training in order to understand the operation of
CyPROM. The command to be run is as follows (we assume execution from
the test scenario directory; program argument paths are relative to
the 'main/' directory):

  $ ../../main/cyprom.py -s ../examples/action_demo

The training includes one scenario file that demonstrates the use of
action modules in CYPROM. All the scenario actions have as target the
machine 'server1'.

The included scenario file is "scenario.yml" with the following
outline. A message is displayed first, followed by a question. In case
the question is answered correctly, a final message is shown, and the
training session ends. Otherwise, an increasing number of hints is
displayed, so as to enable the participant to answer the question as
the training session continues.

In order to answer the question without a graphical interface,
commands such as the ones below can be used:

  $ echo "wrong answer" | nc 127.0.0.1 10000
  $ echo "wrong answer" | nc 127.0.0.1 10001
  $ echo "correct answer" | nc 127.0.0.1 10002
