Test Scenario: Attack Scoring
-----------------------------

This directory is provided for test purposes, and we recommend running
the included training in order to understand the operation of
CyPROM. The command to be run is as follows (we assume execution from
the test scenario directory; program argument paths are relative to
the 'main/' directory):

  $ ../../main/cyprom.py -s ../examples/attack_scoring

The training includes two scenario files, and when the activity
starts, one of them will be selected at random. The training activity
continues until both files are completed, according to the branching
logic of each file. All the scenario actions have as target the
machine 'server1', and the specified action module is 'test', which
will randomly returns SUCCESS or FAILURE.

The included scenario files are:

* scenario1.yml: A sequence of 2 attacks with the following branching
  logic: (i) success of both of them leads to preserving the scenario
  for repeated execution; (ii) failure of either of them leads to
  finishing the scenario. This logic assumes that the training is done
  for defense purposes, and if the attacks are successfull the
  trainees should be given the opportunity to improve their defense
  strategy.

* scenario2.yml: A set of three attacks with a similar branching logic
  to that mentioned above.

For each attack, the participants' score is calculated as follows: (i)
in case of success, points are subtracted from the score (as penalty
for weak defense); (ii) in case of failure, points are added to it (as
reward for a good defense strategy). To analyze the performance of
each participant, we suggest generating the training reports using the
following command (the CSV file will be written in the 'main/'
directory, as 'Team A.csv', etc.):

  $ ../../main/cyprom.py --report
