Test Scenario: Basic Logic
--------------------------

This directory is provided for test purposes, and we recommend running
the included training in order to understand the operation of
CyPROM. The command to be run is as follows (we assume execution from
the test scenario directory):

  $ ../../main/cyprom.py

NOTE: In case you have changed the default scenario directory in the
'config' file, use the following command (program argument paths are
relative to the 'main/' directory):

  $ ../../main/cyprom.py -s ../examples/basic_logic

The training includes two scenario files, and when the activity
starts, the one called 'scenario.yml' (which is a predefined name)
will be selected first. The training activity continues until both
files are completed, according to the branching logic of each
scenario. All the scenario actions have as target the machine
'server1', and the specified action module is 'test', which will
randomly returns SUCCESS or FAILURE.

The included scenario files are:

* scenario.yml: A set of 2 actions with the following branching logic:
  failure of the either of them leads to completing the training. This
  logic assumes that both actions are mandatory and must be executed
  successfully in order for the training to proceed (e.g., some
  configuration actions).

* scenario2.yml: A set of 3 actions with a similar branching logic
  to that mentioned above.
