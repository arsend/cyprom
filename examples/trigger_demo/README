Test Scenario: Trigger Demo
---------------------------

This directory is provided for test purposes, and we recommend running
the included training in order to understand the operation of
CyPROM. The command to be run is as follows (we assume execution from
the test scenario directory; program argument paths are relative to
the 'main/' directory):

  $ ../../main/cyprom.py -s ../examples/test_triggers

The training includes one scenario file that demonstrates the use of
trigger modules in CYPROM. The training activity continues linearly
until the file is completed. All the scenario actions have as target
the machine 'server1', and the specified action module is 'test',
which will randomly returns SUCCESS or FAILURE.

The included scenario file is "scenario.yml" with the following
outline. A sequence of 2 actions is executed one after the other: (i)
the first action has a delayed execution by using the 'timer' trigger;
(ii) the second action execution is controlled externally via the
'signal' trigger.

In order to unblock the second action execution without a graphical
interface, commands such as the ones below can be used (the message
content is irrelevant in this case):

  $ echo "SIGNAL" | nc 127.0.0.1 10000
  $ echo "SIGNAL" | nc 127.0.0.1 10001
  $ echo "SIGNAL" | nc 127.0.0.1 10002
